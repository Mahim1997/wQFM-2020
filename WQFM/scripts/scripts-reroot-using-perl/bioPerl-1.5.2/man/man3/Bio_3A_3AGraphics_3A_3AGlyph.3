.IX Title "Bio::Graphics::Glyph 3"
.TH Bio::Graphics::Glyph 3 "2008-07-07" "perl v5.8.8" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
Bio::Graphics::Glyph \- Base class for Bio::Graphics::Glyph objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
See Bio::Graphics::Panel.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Bio::Graphics::Glyph is the base class for all glyph objects.  Each
glyph is a wrapper around an Bio:SeqFeatureI object, knows how to
render itself on an Bio::Graphics::Panel, and has a variety of
configuration variables.
.PP
End developers will not ordinarily work directly with
Bio::Graphics::Glyph objects, but with Bio::Graphics::Glyph::generic
and its subclasses.  Similarly, most glyph developers will want to
subclass from Bio::Graphics::Glyph::generic because the latter
provides labeling and arrow-drawing facilities.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
This section describes the class and object methods for
Bio::Graphics::Glyph.
.Sh "\s-1CONSTRUCTORS\s0"
.IX Subsection "CONSTRUCTORS"
Bio::Graphics::Glyph objects are constructed automatically by an
Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory, and are not usually created by
end-developer code.
.IP "$glyph = Bio::Graphics::Glyph\->new(\-feature=>$feature,\-factory=>$factory)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph = Bio::Graphics::Glyph->new(-feature=>$feature,-factory=>$factory)"
Given a sequence feature, creates an Bio::Graphics::Glyph object to
display it.  The \fB\-feature\fR argument points to the Bio:SeqFeatureI
object to display, and \fB\-factory\fR indicates an
Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory object from which the glyph will fetch
all its run-time configuration information.  Factories are created and
manipulated by the Bio::Graphics::Panel object.
.Sp
A standard set of options are recognized.  See \s-1OPTIONS\s0.
.Sh "\s-1OBJECT\s0 \s-1METHODS\s0"
.IX Subsection "OBJECT METHODS"
Once a glyph is created, it responds to a large number of methods.  In
this section, these methods are grouped into related categories.
.PP
Retrieving glyph context:
.ie n .IP "$factory = $glyph\->factory" 4
.el .IP "$factory = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->factory" 4
.IX Item "$factory = $glyph->factory"
Get the Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory associated with this object.
This cannot be changed once it is set.
.ie n .IP "$panel = $glyph\->panel" 4
.el .IP "$panel = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->panel" 4
.IX Item "$panel = $glyph->panel"
Get the Bio::Graphics::Panel associated with this object.  This cannot
be changed once it is set.
.ie n .IP "$feature = $glyph\->feature" 4
.el .IP "$feature = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->feature" 4
.IX Item "$feature = $glyph->feature"
Get the sequence feature associated with this object.  This cannot be
changed once it is set.
.ie n .IP "$feature = $glyph\->add_feature(@features)" 4
.el .IP "$feature = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->add_feature(@features)" 4
.IX Item "$feature = $glyph->add_feature(@features)"
Add the list of features to the glyph, creating subparts.  This is
most common done with the track glyph returned by
Ace::Graphics::Panel\->\fIadd_track()\fR.
.ie n .IP "$feature = $glyph\->add_group(@features)" 4
.el .IP "$feature = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->add_group(@features)" 4
.IX Item "$feature = $glyph->add_group(@features)"
This is similar to \fIadd_feature()\fR, but the list of features is treated
as a group and can be configured as a set.
.IP "$glyph\->finished" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->finished"
When you are finished with a glyph, you can call its \fIfinished()\fR method
in order to break cycles that would otherwise cause memory leaks.
\&\fIfinished()\fR is typically only used by the Panel object.
.PP
Retrieving glyph options:
.ie n .IP "$fgcolor = $glyph\->fgcolor" 4
.el .IP "$fgcolor = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->fgcolor" 4

.el .IP "$fillcolor = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->fillcolor" 4
.IX Item "$fillcolor = $glyph->fillcolor"
.PD
These methods return the configured foreground, background, font,
alternative font, and fill colors for the glyph in the form of a
GD::Image color index.

.IX Item "$level = $glyph->level"
The \*(L"level\*(R" is the nesting level of the glyph.
Groups are level \-1, top level glyphs are level 0,
subparts (e.g. exons) are level 1 and so forth.
.PP
Setting an option:
.IP "$glyph\->configure(\-name=>$value)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->configure(-name=>$value)"
You may change a glyph option after it is created using \fIset_option()\fR.
This is most commonly used to configure track glyphs.
.PP

.ie n .IP "$right = $glyph\->right" 4
.el .IP "$right = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->right" 4
.IX Item "$right = $glyph->right"
.PD
These methods return the top, left, bottom and right of the glyph in
pixel coordinates.
.ie n .IP "$height = $glyph\->height" 4
.el .IP "$height = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->height" 4
.IX Item "$height = $glyph->height"
Returns the height of the glyph.  This may be somewhat larger or
smaller than the height suggested by the GlyphFactory, depending on
the type of the glyph.
.ie n .IP "$scale = $glyph\->scale" 4
.el .IP "$scale = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->scale" 4
.IX Item "$scale = $glyph->scale"
Get the scale for the glyph in pixels/bp.

.el .IP "$label = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->label" 4
.IX Item "$label = $glyph->label"
Return a human-readable label for the glyph.
.PP
These methods are called by Bio::Graphics::Track during the layout
process:
.IP "$glyph\->move($dx,$dy)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->move($dx,$dy)"
Move the glyph in pixel coordinates by the indicated delta-x and
delta-y values.
.ie n .IP "($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $glyph\->box" 4
.el .IP "($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->box" 4
.IX Item "($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $glyph->box"
Return the current position of the glyph.
.PP
These methods are intended to be overridden in subclasses:
.IP "$glyph\->calculate_height" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->calculate_height"
Calculate the height of the glyph.
.IP "$glyph\->calculate_left" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->calculate_left"
Calculate the left side of the glyph.

.IX Item "$glyph->calculate_right"
Calculate the right side of the glyph.
.IP "$glyph\->draw($gd,$left,$top)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->draw($gd,$left,$top)"
Optionally offset the glyph by the indicated amount and draw it onto
the GD::Image object.
.IP "$glyph\->draw_label($gd,$left,$top)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->draw_label($gd,$left,$top)"
Draw the label for the glyph onto the provided GD::Image object,
optionally offsetting by the amounts indicated in \f(CW$left\fR and \f(CW$right\fR.
.IP "$glyph\->\fImaxdepth()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->maxdepth()"
This returns the maximum number of levels of feature subparts that the
glyph will recurse through. For example, returning 0 indicates that
the glyph will only draw the top-level feature. Returning 1 indicates
that it will only draw the top-level feature and one level of
subfeatures. Returning 2 will descend down two levels. Overriding this
method will speed up rendering by avoiding creating of a bunch of
subglyphs that will never be drawn.
.Sp
The default behavior is to return undef (unlimited levels of descent)
unless the \-maxdepth option is passed, in which case this number is
returned.
.Sp
Note that Bio::Graphics::Glyph::generic overrides \fImaxdepth()\fR to return
0, meaning no descent into subparts will be performed.
.PP
These methods are useful utility routines:
.ie n .IP "$pixels = $glyph\->map_pt($bases);" 4
.el .IP "$pixels = \f(CW$glyph\fR\->map_pt($bases);" 4
.IX Item "$pixels = $glyph->map_pt($bases);"
Map the indicated base position, given in base pair units, into
pixels, using the current scale and glyph position.
.IP "$glyph\->filled_box($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->filled_box($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)"
Draw a filled rectangle with the appropriate foreground and fill
colors, and pen width onto the GD::Image object given by \f(CW$gd\fR, using
the provided rectangle coordinates.
.IP "$glyph\->filled_oval($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->filled_oval($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)"
As above, but draws an oval inscribed on the rectangle.
.IP "$glyph\->exceeds_depth" 4
.IX Item "$glyph->exceeds_depth"
Returns true if descending into another level of subfeatures will
exceed the value returned by \fImaxdepth()\fR.

.PP
For glyphs that consist of multiple segments, the \fB\-connector\fR option
controls what's drawn between the segments.  The default is undef (no
connector).  Options include:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&   "hat"     an upward-angling conector
\&   "solid"   a straight horizontal connector
\&   "quill"   a decorated line with small arrows indicating strandedness
\&             (like the UCSC Genome Browser uses)
\&   "dashed"  a horizontal dashed line.
\&   "crossed" a straight horizontal connector with an "X" on it
\&              (Can be used when segments are not yet validated
\&               by some internal experiments...)
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-connector_color\fR option controls the color of the connector, if
any.
.PP
The label is printed above the glyph.  You may pass an anonymous
subroutine to \fB\-label\fR, in which case the subroutine will be invoked
with the feature as its single argument.  and is expected to return
the string to use as the description.  If you provide the numeric
value \*(L"1\*(R" to \fB\-description\fR, the description will be read off the
feature's \fIseqname()\fR, \fIinfo()\fR and \fIprimary_tag()\fR methods will be called
until a suitable name is found.  To create a label with the
text \*(L"1\*(R", pass the string \*(L"1 \*(R".  (A 1 followed by a space).
.PP
The description is printed below the glyph.  You may pass an anonymous
subroutine to \fB\-description\fR, in which case the subroutine will be
invoked with the feature as its single argument and is expected to
return the string to use as the description.  If you provide the
numeric value \*(L"1\*(R" to \fB\-description\fR, the description will be read off
the feature's \fIsource_tag()\fR method.  To create a description with the
text \*(L"1\*(R", pass the string \*(L"1 \*(R".  (A 1 followed by a space).
.PP
In the case of \s-1ACEDB\s0 Ace::Sequence feature objects, the feature's
\&\fIinfo()\fR, \fIBrief_identification()\fR and \fILocus()\fR methods will be called to
create a suitable description.
.PP
The \fB\-strand_arrow\fR option, if true, requests that the glyph indicate
which strand it is on, usually by drawing an arrowhead.  Not all
glyphs will respond to this request.  For historical reasons,
\&\fB\-stranded\fR is a synonym for this option.
.PP
\&\fBsort_order\fR: By default, features are drawn with a layout based only on the
position of the feature, assuring a maximal \*(L"packing\*(R" of the glyphs
when bumped.  In some cases, however, it makes sense to display the
glyphs sorted by score or some other comparison, e.g. such that more
\&\*(L"important\*(R" features are nearer the top of the display, stacked above
less important features.  The \-sort_order option allows a few
different built-in values for changing the default sort order (which
is by \*(L"left\*(R" position): \*(L"low_score\*(R" (or \*(L"high_score\*(R") will cause
features to be sorted from lowest to highest score (or vice versa).
\&\*(L"left\*(R" (or \*(L"default\*(R") and \*(L"right\*(R" values will cause features to be
sorted by their position in the sequence.  \*(L"longer\*(R" (or \*(L"shorter\*(R")
will cause the longest (or shortest) features to be sorted first, and
\&\*(L"strand\*(R" will cause the features to be sorted by strand: \*(L"+1\*(R"
(forward) then \*(L"0\*(R" (unknown, or \s-1NA\s0) then \*(L"\-1\*(R" (reverse).
.PP
In all cases, the \*(L"left\*(R" position will be used to break any ties.  To
break ties using another field, options may be strung together using a
\&\*(L"|\*(R" character; e.g. \*(L"strand|low_score|right\*(R" would cause the features
to be sorted first by strand, then score (lowest to highest), then by
\&\*(L"right\*(R" position in the sequence.
.PP
Finally, a subroutine coderef with a $$ prototype can be provided.  It
will receive two \fBglyph\fR as arguments and should return \-1, 0 or 1
(see Perl's \fIsort()\fR function for more information).  For example, to
sort a set of database search hits by bits (stored in the features'
\&\*(L"score\*(R" fields), scaled by the log of the alignment length (with
\&\*(L"start\*(R" position breaking any ties):
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  sort_order = sub ($$) {
\&    my ($glyph1,$glyph2) = @_;
\&    my $a = $glyph1->feature;
\&    my $b = $glyph2->feature;
\&    ( $b->score/log($b->length)
\&          <=>
\&      $a->score/log($a->length) )
\&          ||
\&    ( $a->start <=> $b->start )
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
It is important to remember to use the $$ prototype as shown in the
example.  Otherwise Bio::Graphics will quit with an exception. The
arguments are subclasses of Bio::Graphics::Glyph, not the features
themselves.  While glyphs implement some, but not all, of the feature
methods, to be safe call the two glyphs' \fIfeature()\fR methods in order to
convert them into the actual features.
.PP
The '\-always_sort' option, if true, will sort features even if bumping
is turned off.  This is useful if you would like overlapping features
to stack in a particular order.  Features towards the end of the list
will overlay those towards the beginning of the sort order.
.PP
The \fB\-hilite\fR option draws a colored box behind each feature using the
indicated color. Typically you will pass it a code ref that returns a
color name.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  -hilite => sub { my $name = shift->display_name; 
\&                   return 'yellow' if $name =~ /XYZ/ }
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-no_subparts\fR option will prevent the glyph from searching its
feature for subfeatures. This may enhance performance if you know in
advance that none of your features contain subfeatures.
.SH "SUBCLASSING Bio::Graphics::Glyph"
.IX Header "SUBCLASSING Bio::Graphics::Glyph"
By convention, subclasses are all lower\-case.  Begin each subclass
with a preamble like this one:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& package Bio::Graphics::Glyph::crossbox;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\& use strict;
\& use base qw(Bio::Graphics::Glyph);
.Ve
.PP
Then override the methods you need to.  Typically, just the \fIdraw()\fR
method will need to be overridden.  However, if you need additional
room in the glyph, you may override \fIcalculate_height()\fR,
\&\fIcalculate_left()\fR and \fIcalculate_right()\fR.  Do not directly override
\&\fIheight()\fR, \fIleft()\fR and \fIright()\fR, as their purpose is to cache the values
returned by their calculating cousins in order to avoid time-consuming
recalculation.
.PP
A simple \fIdraw()\fR method looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& sub draw {
\&  my $self = shift;
\&  $self->SUPER::draw(@_);
\&  my $gd = shift;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # and draw a cross through the box
\&  my ($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $self->calculate_boundaries(@_);
\&  my $fg = $self->fgcolor;
\&  $gd->line($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$fg);
\&  $gd->line($x1,$y2,$x2,$y1,$fg);
\& }
.Ve
.PP
This subclass draws a simple box with two lines criss-crossed through
it.  We first call our inherited \fIdraw()\fR method to generate the filled
box and label.  We then call \fIcalculate_boundaries()\fR to return the
coordinates of the glyph, disregarding any extra space taken by
labels.  We call \fIfgcolor()\fR to return the desired foreground color, and
then call \f(CW$gd\fR\->\fIline()\fR twice to generate the criss\-cross.
.PP
For more complex \fIdraw()\fR methods, see Bio::Graphics::Glyph::transcript
and Bio::Graphics::Glyph::segments.
.PP
Please avoid using a specific image class (via \*(L"use \s-1GD\s0\*(R" for example)
within your glyph package. Instead, rely on the image package passed
to the \fIdraw()\fR method. This approach allows for future expansion of
supported image classes without requiring glyph redesign. If you need
access to the specific image classes such as Polygon, Image, or Font,
generate them like such:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& sub draw {
\&  my $self = shift;
\&  my $image_class = shift;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  my $polygon_package = $self->polygon_package->new()
\&  ...
\&  }
