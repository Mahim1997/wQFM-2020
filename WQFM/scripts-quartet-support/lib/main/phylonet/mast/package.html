<BODY>
This package contains an implementations of algorithms that solve the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) Problem.
There are two specific forms of this problem of interest:  (1) UMAST - MAST for unrooted trees and (2) RMAST - 
MAST for rooted trees.  Implementations of algorithms to solve both are provided.
